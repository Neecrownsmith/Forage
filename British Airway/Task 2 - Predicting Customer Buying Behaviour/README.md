## Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour

### Background

Customers today have unprecedented access to information, transforming the traditional buying cycle. To effectively acquire customers, airlines need to be proactive in predicting and influencing their purchasing decisions. Predictive models, driven by high-quality data, play a crucial role in this process. In this task, you are tasked with manipulating and preparing customer booking data to build a robust predictive model.

### Tasks

1. **Data Manipulation and Preparation**
   - Work with the provided customer booking data to ensure it is ready for predictive modeling.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to enhance its quality.
   - Address any missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Building the Predictive Model**
   - Utilize machine learning algorithms to construct a predictive model.
   - Pay close attention to the quality of the data used for training.

3. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the predictive model.
   - Interpret the results to understand the level of predictiveness.
   - Assess the contribution of each variable to the model's predictive power.

### Submission

- Provide code and documentation showcasing the steps taken in data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- Include insights gained from interpreting the model results.
- Clearly outline how each variable influences the predictive power of the model.

### Note

- The success of the predictive model depends on the quality of the data and the thoroughness of the analysis.
- Ensure that the code is well-documented for clarity.

### Resources

- Utilize the relevant data manipulation and machine learning libraries in Python (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-Learn).
- Reference external sources and documentation as needed to enhance your understanding.
