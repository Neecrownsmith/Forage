# British Airway Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Project

## Overview

This project comprises two tasks focused on gaining insights from airline-related data. In Task 1, we perform web scraping to collect reviews about the airline from the Skytrax website. The collected data undergoes analysis, including data cleaning and exploration, to extract meaningful insights. Task 2 revolves around predicting customer buying behavior using customer booking data. The emphasis is on data manipulation, model construction, and thorough evaluation.

## [Task 1: Web Scraping for Company Insights](./Task 1 - Web Scraping for Company Insights)

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - Utilize the provided Jupyter Notebook to collect review data from the Skytrax website.
   - Focus on reviews related to the airline.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Perform data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
   - Apply techniques like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds for insights.

3. **Presentation of Insights:**
   - Summarize findings in a PowerPoint slide using the provided template.
   - Include visualizations and metrics for clear and concise presentation.


## [Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour](./Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour])

1. **Data Manipulation and Preparation:**
   - Clean and preprocess the provided customer booking data.
   - Address any missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Building the Predictive Model:**
   - Utilize machine learning algorithms to construct a predictive model.
   - Ensure thorough consideration of data quality during training.

3. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the predictive model.
   - Interpret results to understand the level of predictiveness.
   - Assess the contribution of each variable to the model's predictive power.

### Submission

- Provide well-documented code showcasing data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- Include insights gained from interpreting the model results.
- Clearly outline how each variable influences the predictive power of the model.
