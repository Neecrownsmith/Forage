## Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
Understanding the business through data

#### The background information on this Task 2

The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data and the AD wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis.

##### The data that was sent over includes:

      • Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
      • Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
      • Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not
      
##### Tasks to do
**Sub-Task 1:**

Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. This first subtask is for you to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset.

**Sub-Task 2:**

Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it.

**Sub-Task 3:**

Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation – which other sources of data should the client provide you with and which open source datasets might be useful?

**Note:** Use the 2 datasets within the additional resources for this task and if you’re unsure on where to start with visualizing data, use the accompanying links. Be sure to also use the data description document to understand what the columns represent. The task description document outlines the higher-level motivation of the project.

**How to solve this task:**
  Think about ways you can define price sensitivity. Make sure to think of all possible ways and investigate them.
