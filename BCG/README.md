## Overview

The BCG Data Science Virtual Internship Program comprises four modules that cover various aspects of data science and analytics. Each module involves real-world tasks and problem-solving scenarios.

## [Task 1 - Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing](./Task 1 - Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing)

This section provides insights into understanding the business context, formulating hypotheses, and communicating findings through an email to the Associate Director.

## [Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis](./Task_2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis)

Explore historical customer data, pricing data, and churn indicators. Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity's correlation with churn and summarize key findings.

## [Task 3 - Feature Engineering & Modelling](./Task_3_Feature_Engineering_and_Modelling)

Uncover signals in the data, predict churn probability, and evaluate model performance. This section involves building features and training a Random Forest classifier.

## [Task 4 - Findings & Recommendations](./Task_4_Findings_and_Recommendations)

Develop an abstract summarizing key findings and recommendations for the client. Reflect on the impact of the model on the client's bottom line.
