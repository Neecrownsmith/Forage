## Task 4 - Findings & Recommendations
Presenting your results and giving recommended actions to the client

#### The background information on this Task 3

The client wants a quick update on the project progress.

The AD wants you to draft an abstract (executive summary) of your findings so far.

##### Tasks to do
Develop an abstract slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far, keeping in mind that this will be for the key stakeholders meeting which the Head of the SME division, as well as other various stakeholders, will be attending.

**Note:** a steering committee meeting is a meeting where the BCG team presents key findings and recommendations (and/or project progress) to key client stakeholders.

Please use the template below and submit your summary slide in PDF format. 

A few things to think about for this abstract include:

What is the most important number or metric to share with the client?
What impact would the model have on the client’s bottom line?

**How to solve this task:**

♦ What do you think the client wants to hear? How much detail should you go into, especially with the technical details of your work?

♦ Always test what you write with the “so what?” test, i.e. sharing a fact, even an interesting one, only matters if the client can actually do something useful with it. E.g. 60% of your customers are from City A is pointless, but customers in City A should be prioritized for giving discount as they are among your most valuable ones, if true, is an actionable finding
